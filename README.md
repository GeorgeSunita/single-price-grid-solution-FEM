Single-price-grid-component-master solution.
 I have been learning CSS with Jonas Schmedtmann and have tried to practice the use of flexbox, BEM methodology and scss preprocessor in this project. The image is responsive and has 3 breakpoints at 600px, 900px and 1250px. Also used NPM scripts node-sass package to compile and automatically reload the page.
